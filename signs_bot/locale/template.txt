After you have placed the Signs Bot Box, you can start the bot by means of the 'On' button in the box menu.=
If the bot returns to its box right away, you will likely need to charge it with electrical energy (techage) first.=
The bot then runs straight up until it reaches an obstacle (a step with two or more blocks up or down or a sign.)=
If the bot first reaches a sign it will execute the commands on the sign.=
If the command(s) on the sign is e.g. 'turn_around', the bot turns and goes back.=
In this case, the bot reaches his box again and turns off.=
The Signs Bot Box has an inventory with 6 stacks for signs and 8 stacks for other items (to be placed/dug by the bot).=
This inventory simulates the bot internal inventory.=
That means you will only have access to the inventory if the bot is turned off ('sitting' in his box).=
You simply control the direction of the bot by means of the 'turn left' and 'turn right' signs (signs with the arrow).=
The bot can run over steps (one block up/down). But there are also commands to move the bot up and down.=
It is not necessary to mark a way back to the box.=
With the command 'turn_off' the bot will turn off and be back in his box from every position.=
The same applies if you turn off the bot by the box menu.=
If the bot reaches a sign from the wrong direction (from back or sides) the sign will be ignored.=
The bot will walk over.=
All predefined signs have a menu with a list of the bot commands.=
These signs can't be changed, but you can craft and program your own signs.=
For this you have to use the 'command' sign.=
This sign has an edit field for your commands and a help page with all available commands.=
Also for your own signs it is important to know:=
After the execution of the last command of the sign, the bot falls back into its default behaviour and runs in its taken direction.=
A standard job for the bot is to move items from one chest to another=
(chest or node with a chest like inventory).=
This can be done by means of the two signs 'take item' and 'add item'.=
These signs have to be placed on top of chest nodes.=
In addition to the signs the bot can be controlled by means of sensors.=
Sensors like the Bot Sensor have two states: on and off.=
If the Bot Sensor detects a bot it will switch to the state 'on' and=
sends a signal to a connected block, called an actuator.=
Sensors are:=
- Bot Sensor: Sends a signal when the robot passes by=
- Node Sensor: Sends a signal when it detects any node=
- Crop Sensor: Sends a signal when, for example wheat is fully grown=
- Bot Chest: Sends a signal depending on the chest state (empty, full)=
Actuators are:=
- Signs Bot Box: Can turn the bot off and on=
- Control Unit: Can be used to exchange the sign to lead the bot=
Additional sensors and actuator can be added by other mods.=
To send a signal from a sensor to an actuator, the sensor has to be connected (paired) with actuator.=
To connect sensor and actuator, the Sensor Connection Tool has to be used.=
Simply click with the tool on both blocks and the sensor will be connected with the actuator.=
A successful connection is indicated by a ping/pong noise.=
Before you connect sensor with actuator, take care that the actuator is in the requested state.=
For example: If you want to start the Bot with a sensor, connect the sensor with the Bot Box,=
when the Bot is in the state 'on'. Otherwise the sensor signal will stop the Bot,=
instead of starting it.=
The following applies to all commands that are used to place items in the bot inventory, like:=
- take_item <num> <slot>=
- pickup_items <slot>=
- trash_sign <slot>=
- harvest <slot>=
- dig_front <slot> <lvl>=
- dig_left <slot> <lvl>=
- dig_right <slot> <lvl>=
- dig_below <slot> <lvl>=
- dig_above <slot> <lvl>=
If no slot or slot 0 was specified with the command (case A), all 8 slots of the bot inventory =
are checked one after the other. If a slot was specified (case B), only this slot is checked.=
In both cases the following applies: If the slot is preconfigured and fits the item, =
or if the slot is not configured and empty, or is only partially filled with the item type =
(which should be added), then the items are added.=
If not all items can be added, the remaining slots will be tried out in case A.=
Anything that could not be added to your own inventory goes back.=
The following applies to all commands that are used to take items from the bot inventory, like:=
- add_item <num> <slot>=
It doesn't matter whether a slot is configured or not. The bot takes the first stack that =
it can find from its own inventory and tries to use it.=
If a slot is specified, it only takes this, if no slot has been specified, it checks all of =
them one after the other, starting from slot 1 until it finds something.=
If the number found is smaller than requested, he tries to take the rest out of any slot.=
