1. Place your rails and build a route with two endpoints. Junctions are allowed as long as each route has its own start and endpoint.=
10. Check the cart state via the chat command: /mycart <num>@n   '<num>' is the cart number=
11. Drop items into the Minecart and punch the cart to start it, or 'sneak+click' the Minecart to get the items back.=
12. Dig the empty cart with a second 'sneak+click' (as usual).=
2. Place a Railway Buffer at both endpoints (buffers are always needed, they store the route and timing information).=
3. Give both Railway Buffers unique station names, like Oxford and Cambridge.=
4. Place a Minecart at a buffer and give it a cart number (1..999)=
5. Drive from buffer to buffer in both directions using the Minecart(!) to record the routes (use 'right-left' keys to control the Minecart).=
6. Punch the buffers to check the connection data (e.g. 'Oxford: connected to Cambridge').=
7. Optional: Configure the Minecart stop time in one or both buffers. The Minecart will then start automatically after the configured time.=
8. Optional: Protect your rail network with the Protection Landmarks (one Landmark at least every 16 nodes/meters).=
9. Place a Minecart in front of the buffer and check whether it starts after the configured time.=

Summary=
Used as buffer on both rail ends. Needed to be able to record the cart routes=
Used to load/unload Minecart. The Hopper can push/pull items to/from chests and drop/pickup items to/from Minecarts. To unload a Minecart place the hopper below the rail. To load the Minecart, place the hopper right next to the Minecart.=
